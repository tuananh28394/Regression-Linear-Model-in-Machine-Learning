# Regression-Model-in-Machine-Learning
## This is my individual assignment about Regression Models in Machine Learning Class.
### The content is credited partially to Professor Long He, Department of Decision Sciences, The George Washington University
### The main purpose here is to experiment the linear regression and KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) algorithms respectively on a higher-dimensional dataset and observe the change of prediction performance based on elements such as dimensionality and flexibility.
The experiment is built on top of the 3rd-order polynomial model, clearly describle by the function: 𝑦=𝛽0+𝛽1∗𝑥+𝛽2∗𝑥2+𝛽3∗𝑥3+𝜖,  𝜖∼N(0,𝜎2).
